# TOTToken : Trecento ERC20 token

Trecento will initially issue 20 million TOT tokens.

75% TOT tokens will be allocated to the token sale purchasers, 15% to the foundation, 5% to the founder and 5% to bounty programs. (check finishMinting function)

The final amount will depend on the bonuses that would be applied to the token sale. 

TOT token is developed on Ethereumâ€™s blockchain and conform to the ERC20 Token Standard.

During your KYC process, you will be asked to provide your Ethereum address to receive your tokens.

Tokens will be delivered with smart contract shortly after the ICO ends. Once finishMinting is called, tokens will no longer be issued.
