# Solparse

Pegjs-based Parser for the Solidity Programming language.

It was originally a fork of [Consensys' solidity-parser](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser) by Tim Coulter. @cgewecke, @duaraghav8 and @federicobond are co-authors.

## Note
Solparse is primarily meant for [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium). It is subject to surprise breaking changes because its sole purpose is to make life easier for the linter. **Avoid using solparse in your production systems**.
